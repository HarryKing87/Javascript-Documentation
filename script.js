/* We'd like to create a new HTML element in the index.html file...
So, I've first created a variable (newHeading), that nests inside a new 
element creation. Basically, I tell the program to create a new element (createElement),
which will be a new heading (h1) and then this element will be displayed in the document.


After that, we want the new variable (newHeading) to have a specific id in our HTML file
which will be called "header-new". Specifically, the newHeading (which we declared on line 22)
will be used to create the new id as shown on line 24.

Same, we will use the newHeading variable to edit the inside of the element we created.
So, inside the newHeading, we'll be editing the innerHTML, which will display "This is a new header".



Finally, as the createElement method (Line 22) can't just put the edited and added element
inside the HTML on its own, we use the appendChild method with the newHeading variable to insert the new element into our HTML file.

//UNDERSTANDING OBJECTS AND HOW THEY WORK

/* In this example, I'm going to be making a short tutorial on
* What is an object
* Object Syntax
* Short Example

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type.
We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; ** spaceship is an empty object

We fill an object with unordered data. 
This data is organized into key-value pairs. 
A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory 
that holds a value.

** An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};

The spaceship object has two properties Fuel Type and color.
'Fuel Type' has quotation marks because it contains a space character.

Let's get into some examples...This time we're going 
to make another type of 'Fuel Type', the Turbo Power
*/

// This is an object, called fasterShip...
const fasterShip = {
  color: "silver",
  "Fuel Type": "Turbo Fuel",
  name: "Jonathan"
};

/* There are two ways we can access an object’s property. 
Let’s explore the first way— dot notation, ..

You’ve used dot notation to access the properties and methods 
of built-in objects and data instances: 

'hello'.length; ** For example, this returns 5

We can do the exact same thing with an object and its keys...

For example...
*/

fasterShip.color;
fasterShip["Fuel Type"];

// The upper two examples will give us a result of silver and Turbo Fuel
// But, if we enter a key that is not defined in the object model
// then, the result will be "undefined".
// We can always log the results if we need to see the results

//CHANGING OBJECT ATTRIBUTES

/* During a project, there might be some times, where 
we must change some things into our code or assign 
new values into some of our objects. 
 
That's why there are a couple of commands we can create,
to assign and delete values from within an object.

For example:

** We assign a new object, called spaceship

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color: 'silver',
  'Secret Mission' : 'Discover life outside of Earth.'
};

** We then log the object into the console and we get
** what the whole object contains...

console.log(spaceship);

** But, if we log an objects name and change it to another,
** the new name will be assigned as the new one ('Mars')
spaceship.homePlanet = 'Mars';
console.log(spaceship);


** The same goes with the name...
spaceship.name = 'Jonathan';
console.log(spaceship);

** We can delete an object key by typing this command:
delete spaceship.name;

** And this will delete the whole name key...
*/

/* Besides the normal (as we've seen) object syntax,
we can also put a whole function into an object 
*/

const cafeteria = {
 greeting() {
  console.log('Hello and welcome to our cafeteria!');
}
};
cafeteria.greeting;

//OBJECT PASS BY REFERENCE

/* Often we can declare an object with the "let" keyword
and then be able to change the whole object and its keys
with a brand new one. Objects are passed by reference. 
This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object
into a function as an argument, the computer interprets 
the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory 
holding that object. As a result, functions which change 
object properties actually mutate the object permanently 
(even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

**EXAMPLE**

const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};

let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};

paintIt(spaceship);

spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'

Down here, we'll create a live example of an object 
reassignment

*/

//This is a simple object
let Thespaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth'
};

// We create a new function with the obj(object's name)
// and as a parameter, we type in the key we'd like to 
// change...In this case, we'd like to change the 
// Fuel Type into 'Avocado Oil'
let greenEnergy = obj => {
  obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil';
}

// We then create another function, that assigns a new key
// instead of changing one, as we did above...
let remotelyDisable = obj => {
  obj.disabled = true;
}

// Referencing the two functions, we'll get a whole new 
// object, with new keys...
greenEnergy(Thespaceship);
remotelyDisable(Thespaceship);
console.log(Thespaceship);

/* 
RESULT

{ 'Fuel Type': 'avocado oil',
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  disabled: true }

  
*/

//LOOPING THROUGH OBJECTS 
let spaceship = {
  crew: {
  captain: { 
      name: 'Lily', 
      degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
      cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
      },
  'chief officer': { 
      name: 'Dan', 
      degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
      agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
      },
  medic: { 
      name: 'Clementine', 
      degree: 'Physics',

for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`);
}

//The exact same thing we're doing here with the inversed order...
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
console.log(`${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].degree}`);
}

for (let enginesStuff in spaceship.engines) {
  console.log(`${enginesStuff}: ${spaceship.engines[enginesStuff].name}`);
}

// ADVANCED OBJECTS

/*
Objects are collections of related data and functionality. We store that functionality in methods on our objects:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  }
};
In our goat object we have a .makeSound() method. We can invoke the .makeSound() method on goat.

goat.makeSound(); // Prints baaa
Nice, we have a goat object that can print baaa to the console. Everything seems to be working fine. What if we wanted to add a new method to our goat object called .diet() that prints the goat‘s dietType?

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"
That’s strange, why is dietType not defined even though it’s a property of goat? That’s because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don’t automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here’s where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore
The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object’s properties. In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we’re accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

Let's see an example:
*/

// We first create a simple object with two simple keys and
// a function, called provideInfo()
// The function will return a specific phrase, which 
// will contain the other two keys (model & energyLevel)
const robot = {
  model: '1E78V2',
  energyLevel: 100,
  provideInfo() {
    return 'I am ' + this.model + ' and my current energy level is ' + this.energyLevel;
  }
};

console.log(robot.provideInfo());

// ARROW FUNCTIONS AND THIS.

/*
We saw in the previous exercise that for a method, the calling object is the object the method belongs to. If we use the this keyword in a method then the value of this is the calling object. However, it becomes a bit more complicated when we start using arrow functions for methods. Take a look at the example below:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet: () => {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); // Prints undefined
In the comment, you can see that goat.diet() would log undefined. So what happened? Notice that in the .diet() is defined using an arrow function.

Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. In the code snippet above, the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope, which doesn’t have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.

To read more about either arrow functions or the global object check out the MDN documentation of the global object and arrow functions.

The key takeaway from the example above is to avoid using arrow functions when using this in a method!

Let's use the same example, but with a different
name:
*/

const advancedRobot = {
  energyLevel: 100,
  checkEnergy()  {
    console.log('Energy is currently at ' + advancedRobot.energyLevel + '%')
  }
}

advancedRobot.checkEnergy();

// PRIVACY

/* As I was reading the Codecademy documentation on 
Javascript objects, I found out an interesting thing about 
some things called getters and setters (We'll find out
what these are in the next lessons).

Accessing and updating properties is fundamental in working with objects. However, there are cases in which we don’t want other code simply accessing and updating an object’s properties. When discussing privacy in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.

Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here’s an example of using _ to prepend a property.

const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}
In the example above, the _amount is not intended to be directly manipulated.

Even so, it is still possible to reassign _amount:

bankAccount._amount = 1000000;

In later exercises, we’ll cover the use of methods called getters and setters. Both methods are used to respect the intention of properties prepended, or began, with _. Getters can return the value of internal properties and setters can safely reassign property values. For now, let’s see what happens if we can change properties that don’t have setters or getters.

Example below:
*/

const anotherRobot = {
  _energyLevel: 100,
  recharge(){
    this._energyLevel += 30;
    console.log(`Recharged! Energy is currently at ${this._energyLevel}%.`)
  }
};

anotherRobot._energyLevel = 'high';
console.log(anotherRobot.recharge());

// This returns: 

// Recharged! Energy is currently at high30%.
// undefined

// Notice that a funky string is printed to the console!
// This is known as a side-effect of type-coercion. 
// No need to worry about what this means for now, but 
// it’s important to understand that you can cause unwanted
// side-effects when mutating objects and their properties.

 // GETTERS
 
 /*
 Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property! Let’s take a look at a getter method:

const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  }
}

person.fullName; // 'John Doe'
Notice that in the getter method above:

We use the get keyword followed by a function.
We use an if...else conditional to check if both _firstName and _lastName exist (by making sure they both return truthy values) and then return a different value depending on the result.
We can access the calling object’s internal properties using this. In fullName, we’re accessing both this._firstName and this._lastName.
In the last line we call fullName on person. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re accessing a property.
Now that we’ve gone over syntax, let’s discuss some notable advantages of using getter methods:

Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
Getters can return different values using conditionals.
In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.
Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function. If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name like we did in the example above.

Okay, so let's check on an example:
 */

 // Here we have our object, called advancedObjectRobot
const advancedObjectRobot = {
  // Our robot has a model and an energyLevel
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  // It also has a single method inside it
  get energyLevel() {
    // So here, we check if the energyLevel
    // (which apparently is 100 is a number)
    // If it's a number, then the function will
    // return a string
    if ( typeof this._energyLevel === 'number')
    {

    
    return 'My current energy level is ' + this._energyLevel;
    }
    // If not, the function will return another
    // string
    else {
      return 'System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level';
    }
  },

  // I created a brand new getter here, that gets the
  // model of the robot and if it's valid, it logs
  // that the model number is valid in the console
  get model() {
    if (this._model === '1E78V2')
    return 'Model Number Valid'

    else 
    return 'Model Number Invalid, try again...'
  }
};

// Here we simply log the methods from the objects...
console.log(advancedObjectRobot.energyLevel);
console.log(advancedObjectRobot.model);

// SETTERS

/*
Along with getter methods, we can also create setter methods which reassign values of existing properties within an object. Let’s see an example of a setter method:

const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
};
Notice that in the example above:

We can perform a check for what value is being assigned to this._age.
When we use the setter method, only values that are numbers will reassign this._age
There are different outputs depending on what values are used to reassign this._age.
Then to use the setter method:

person.age = 40;
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 40
person.age = '40'; // Logs: You must assign a number to age
Setter methods like age do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re reassigning the value of a property.

Like getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties. For example, in the example above, we can still set ._age directly:

person._age = 'forty-five'
console.log(person._age); // Prints forty-five

Another example:

*/

const theBestRobot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  _numOfSensors: 15,
  get numOfSensors(){
    if(typeof this._numOfSensors === 'number'){
      return this._numOfSensors;
    } 
    else {
      return 'Sensors are currently down.'
    }
  },
  set numOfSensors(num) {
if (typeof num === 'number' && num >= 0)
{
  this._numOfSensors = num;
}
else 
console.log('Pass in a number that is greater than or equal to 0');
  }
};

theBestRobot.numOfSensors = 38;
console.log(theBestRobot.numOfSensors);
console.log(theBestRobot._model);
console.log(theBestRobot._energyLevel);

// FACTORY FUNCTIONS

/*
So far we’ve been creating objects individually, but there are times where we want to create many instances of an object quickly. Here’s where factory functions come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.

Let’s say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters:

const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return { 
    name: name,
    age: age, 
    energySource: energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    } 
  }
};
In the monsterFactory function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: name, age, energySource, and scare(). To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call monsterFactory with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:

const ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
ghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'
Now we have a ghost object as a result of calling monsterFactory() with the needed arguments. With monsterFactory in place, we don’t have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the monsterFactory function with the necessary arguments to take over the world make a monster for us!
*/

const robotFactory = (model, mobile) => {
  return {
    model: model,
    mobile: mobile,
    beep() {
      console.log('Beep Boop');
    }
  }
}

const tinCan = robotFactory('P-500', true);

tinCan.beep();


// We can also do the exact same thing by leaving the object keys by themselves
// without changing anything...For example...

/*

function robotFactory(model, mobile){
  return {
    model,
    mobile,
    beep() {
      console.log('Beep Boop');
    }
  }
}

// To check that the property value shorthand technique worked:
const newRobot = robotFactory('P-501', false)
console.log(newRobot.model)
console.log(newRobot.mobile)

*/

// DESTRUCTURED ASSIGNMENT

/*
We often want to extract key-value pairs from objects and save them as variables. Take for example the following object:

const vampire = {
  name: 'Dracula',
  residence: 'Transylvania',
  preferences: {
    day: 'stay inside',
    night: 'satisfy appetite'
  }
};
If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could using the following code:

const residence = vampire.residence; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania' 
However, we can also take advantage of a destructuring technique called destructured assignment to save ourselves some keystrokes. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an object’s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object. Take a look at the example below:

const { residence } = vampire; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
Look back at the vampire object’s properties in the first code example. Then, in the example above, we declare a new variable residence that extracts the value of the residence property of vampire. When we log the value of residence to the console, 'Transylvania' is printed.

We can even use destructured assignment to grab nested properties of an object:

const { day } = vampire.preferences; 
console.log(day); // Prints 'stay inside'

An example:
*/

const superRobot = {
  model: '1E78V2',
  energyLevel: 100,
  functionality: {
    beep() {
      console.log('Beep Boop');
    },
    fireLaser() {
      console.log('Pew Pew');
    },
  }
};

// We put the name functionality that currently represents the third key of our 
// object call superRobot.
const {functionality} = robot;

// We then call the const just above to recall the beep method...
functionality.beep();

// BUILT-IN OBJECT METHODS

/*
In the previous exercises we’ve been creating instances of objects that have their own methods. But, we can also take advantage of built-in methods for Objects!

For example, we have access to object instance methods like: .hasOwnProperty(), .valueOf(), and many more! Practice your documentation reading skills and check out: MDN’s object instance documentation.

There are also useful Object class methods such as Object.assign(), Object.entries(), and Object.keys() just to name a few. For a comprehensive list, browse: MDN’s object instance documentation.

Let’s get acquainted with some of these methods and their documentation.

// TEAM STATS PROJECT

/*
We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team.
Basketball, soccer, tennis, or water polo, you pick it. 
It’s your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal: 
arrays, objects, etc.

Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well 
as gain insights from them. For example, you might want to get the 
total number of games your team has played, or the average score of all 
of their games.

Steps:

1.
We want a data structure to store the information about our team. 
Create an empty team object.

2.
Our team has players, and the team plays games. We want to represent both of these. 
Add two properties to your team object. A _players property and a _games property 
that are both initialized to empty arrays.

3.
Populate the empty array that corresponds to the _players key in your team 
object with three actual players. They should be in the following format:

{
  firstName: 'Pablo',
  lastName: 'Sanchez',
  age: 11
}
You should put each player on a new line to prevent the line from getting too long.

4.
Populate the empty array that corresponds to the _games key in 
your object with three actual games. They should be in the following format:

{
  opponent: 'Broncos',
  teamPoints: 42,
  opponentPoints: 27
}

5.
Create getter methods for your _players and _games keys. 
You do not need to create setter methods, because we don’t want 
anyone to change the values saved to these keys.

6.
We want to add a new player to your team. 
Add a method addPlayer to your team object. 
This method should take in three parameters: firstName, 
lastName, and age. It should create a player object, 
and add them to the team‘s players array.

7.
Below your team object, invoke your addPlayer method on the following players:
Steph Curry Age 28,Lisa Leslie Age 44, and Bugs Bunny Age 76.

Print out the team‘s players to check they were all properly added.

8.
The scorekeeper has some new information for us! 
Add a similar method for recording game results called addGame that:

takes in an opponent’s name,
your team’s points,
the opponent’s points,
creates a game object,
adds the game object to your team‘s games array.

9.
Invoke your addGame method on three games and print the team‘s updated games array.

The answer to the project is down below...
