/* We'd like to create a new HTML element in the index.html file...
So, I've first created a variable (newHeading), that nests inside a new 
element creation. Basically, I tell the program to create a new element (createElement),
which will be a new heading (h1) and then this element will be displayed in the document.


After that, we want the new variable (newHeading) to have a specific id in our HTML file
which will be called "header-new". Specifically, the newHeading (which we declared on line 22)
will be used to create the new id as shown on line 24.

Same, we will use the newHeading variable to edit the inside of the element we created.
So, inside the newHeading, we'll be editing the innerHTML, which will display "This is a new header".



Finally, as the createElement method (Line 22) can't just put the edited and added element
inside the HTML on its own, we use the appendChild method with the newHeading variable to insert the new element into our HTML file.

 "I will be trying to learn more Javascript concepts and try to implement them into my own personal ones." +

"because I know that sometimes learning alone can be very hard and frustrating." +

// MATH METHODS
// There are tons of ways to create a program that calculates numbers 
// and then chooses a specific one or a random. Such a program
// can be written with the help of math methods. 
// Math methods are used to show numbers and also randomize
// their sequence. Let me show you.

// Math.random() => Generates a decimal between 0 and 1
// Math.floor() => Rounds the decimal to the closest whole number.

// For example we'd like to make a program generate a number
// between 1 and 6


// We first "collect" the ids from each element we'd like to edit
let button = document.getElementById('textButton');
let text = document.getElementById('textarea');

// Secondly, we'd like to generate a new number everytime 
// we push the button. So, everytime we click (button.onclick)
// the button, a function will fire.
// The function will contain a variety of things.

button.onclick = function() {
    // This is a variable that contains an array of numbers from 1 to 6.
    
    let numbers = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6'];
    
    // The randomNumbers variable contains the methods
    // we used above in the previous example (random & floor)
    // With this way, we generate a random number from 1 to 6
    // and then we take this number and reduce it to the clearest decimal.
    // After we do that, the number will be changed in the innerHTML in the whole sentence.

    var randomNumbers = Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length + 1);
    text.innerHTML = "The generated number is " + randomNumbers;
};

// At last, we append everything to be displayed in the HTML file.

document.body.appendChild(button);
document.body.appendChild(text);
document.body.appendChild(numbers);
document.body.appendChild(randomNumbers);

//UNDERSTANDING OBJECTS AND HOW THEY WORK

/* In this example, I'm going to be making a short tutorial on
* What is an object
* Object Syntax
* Short Example

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type.
We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; ** spaceship is an empty object

We fill an object with unordered data. 
This data is organized into key-value pairs. 
A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory 
that holds a value.

** An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};

The spaceship object has two properties Fuel Type and color.
'Fuel Type' has quotation marks because it contains a space character.

Let's get into some examples...This time we're going 
to make another type of 'Fuel Type', the Turbo Power
*/

// This is an object, called fasterShip...
const fasterShip = {
    color: "silver",
    "Fuel Type": "Turbo Fuel",
    name: "Jonathan"
  };
  
  /* There are two ways we can access an object’s property. 
  Let’s explore the first way— dot notation, ..
  
  You’ve used dot notation to access the properties and methods 
  of built-in objects and data instances: 
  
  'hello'.length; ** For example, this returns 5
  
  We can do the exact same thing with an object and its keys...
  
  For example...
  */
  
  fasterShip.color;
  fasterShip["Fuel Type"];
  
  // The upper two examples will give us a result of silver and Turbo Fuel
  // But, if we enter a key that is not defined in the object model
  // then, the result will be "undefined".
  // We can always log the results if we need to see the results
