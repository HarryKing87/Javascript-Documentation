/* We'd like to create a new HTML element in the index.html file...
So, I've first created a variable (newHeading), that nests inside a new 
element creation. Basically, I tell the program to create a new element (createElement),
which will be a new heading (h1) and then this element will be displayed in the document.


After that, we want the new variable (newHeading) to have a specific id in our HTML file
which will be called "header-new". Specifically, the newHeading (which we declared on line 22)
will be used to create the new id as shown on line 24.

Same, we will use the newHeading variable to edit the inside of the element we created.
So, inside the newHeading, we'll be editing the innerHTML, which will display "This is a new header".



Finally, as the createElement method (Line 22) can't just put the edited and added element
inside the HTML on its own, we use the appendChild method with the newHeading variable to insert the new element into our HTML file.

// Math.random() => Generates a decimal between 0 and 1
// Math.floor() => Rounds the decimal to the closest whole number.

// For example we'd like to make a program generate a number
// between 1 and 6

// We first "collect" the ids from each element we'd like to edit
let button = document.getElementById("textButton");
let text = document.getElementById("textarea");

  // we used above in the previous example (random & floor)
  // With this way, we generate a random number from 1 to 6
  // and then we take this number and reduce it to the clearest decimal.
  // After we do that, the number will be changed in the innerHTML in the whole sentence.

//UNDERSTANDING OBJECTS AND HOW THEY WORK

/* In this example, I'm going to be making a short tutorial on
* What is an object
* Object Syntax
* Short Example

Objects can be assigned to variables just like any JavaScript type.
We use curly braces, {}, to designate an object literal:

let spaceship = {}; ** spaceship is an empty object

We fill an object with unordered data. 
This data is organized into key-value pairs. 
A key is like a variable name that points to a location in memory 
that holds a value.

** An object literal with two key-value pairs
let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'diesel',
  color: 'silver'
};

The spaceship object has two properties Fuel Type and color.
'Fuel Type' has quotation marks because it contains a space character.

Let's get into some examples...This time we're going 
to make another type of 'Fuel Type', the Turbo Power
*/

// This is an object, called fasterShip...
const fasterShip = {
  color: "silver",
  "Fuel Type": "Turbo Fuel",
  name: "Jonathan"
};

/* There are two ways we can access an object’s property. 
Let’s explore the first way— dot notation, ..

You’ve used dot notation to access the properties and methods 
of built-in objects and data instances: 

'hello'.length; ** For example, this returns 5

We can do the exact same thing with an object and its keys...

For example...
*/

fasterShip.color;
fasterShip["Fuel Type"];

// The upper two examples will give us a result of silver and Turbo Fuel
// But, if we enter a key that is not defined in the object model
// then, the result will be "undefined".
// We can always log the results if we need to see the results

//CHANGING OBJECT ATTRIBUTES

/* During a project, there might be some times, where 
we must change some things into our code or assign 
new values into some of our objects. 
 
That's why there are a couple of commands we can create,
to assign and delete values from within an object.

For example:

** We assign a new object, called spaceship

let spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color: 'silver',
  'Secret Mission' : 'Discover life outside of Earth.'
};

** We then log the object into the console and we get
** what the whole object contains...

console.log(spaceship);

** But, if we log an objects name and change it to another,
** the new name will be assigned as the new one ('Mars')
spaceship.homePlanet = 'Mars';
console.log(spaceship);


** The same goes with the name...
spaceship.name = 'Jonathan';
console.log(spaceship);

** We can delete an object key by typing this command:
delete spaceship.name;

** And this will delete the whole name key...
*/

/* Besides the normal (as we've seen) object syntax,
we can also put a whole function into an object 
*/

const cafeteria = {
 greeting() {
  console.log('Hello and welcome to our cafeteria!');
}
};
cafeteria.greeting;

//OBJECT PASS BY REFERENCE

/* Often we can declare an object with the "let" keyword
and then be able to change the whole object and its keys
with a brand new one. Objects are passed by reference. 
This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object
into a function as an argument, the computer interprets 
the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory 
holding that object. As a result, functions which change 
object properties actually mutate the object permanently 
(even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

**EXAMPLE**

const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};

let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};

paintIt(spaceship);

spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'

Down here, we'll create a live example of an object 
reassignment

*/

//This is a simple object
let Thespaceship = {
  'Fuel Type' : 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet : 'Earth'
};

// We create a new function with the obj(object's name)
// and as a parameter, we type in the key we'd like to 
// change...In this case, we'd like to change the 
// Fuel Type into 'Avocado Oil'
let greenEnergy = obj => {
  obj['Fuel Type'] = 'avocado oil';
}

// We then create another function, that assigns a new key
// instead of changing one, as we did above...
let remotelyDisable = obj => {
  obj.disabled = true;
}

// Referencing the two functions, we'll get a whole new 
// object, with new keys...
greenEnergy(Thespaceship);
remotelyDisable(Thespaceship);
console.log(Thespaceship);

/* 
RESULT

{ 'Fuel Type': 'avocado oil',
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  disabled: true }

//LOOPING THROUGH OBJECTS 
let spaceship = {

      name: 'Lily', 
      degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
      cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') }

//For example, we declared variable 'crewMember', that represents everything in the object(the small inherited objects('captain, 'chief officer', medic, translator))
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`);
}

//The exact same thing we're doing here with the inversed order...
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
console.log(`${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].degree}`);
}

for (let enginesStuff in spaceship.engines) {
  console.log(`${enginesStuff}: ${spaceship.engines[enginesStuff].name}`);
}

// ADVANCED OBJECTS

/*
Objects are collections of related data and functionality. We store that functionality in methods on our objects:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  }
};
In our goat object we have a .makeSound() method. We can invoke the .makeSound() method on goat.

goat.makeSound(); // Prints baaa
Nice, we have a goat object that can print baaa to the console. Everything seems to be working fine. What if we wanted to add a new method to our goat object called .diet() that prints the goat‘s dietType?

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"
That’s strange, why is dietType not defined even though it’s a property of goat? That’s because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don’t automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here’s where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore
The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object’s properties. In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we’re accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

Let's see an example:
*/

// We first create a simple object with two simple keys and
// a function, called provideInfo()
// The function will return a specific phrase, which 
// will contain the other two keys (model & energyLevel)
const robot = {
  model: '1E78V2',
  energyLevel: 100,
  provideInfo() {
    return 'I am ' + this.model + ' and my current energy level is ' + this.energyLevel;
  }
};

console.log(robot.provideInfo());

// ARROW FUNCTIONS AND THIS.

/*
We saw in the previous exercise that for a method, the calling object is the object the method belongs to. If we use the this keyword in a method then the value of this is the calling object. However, it becomes a bit more complicated when we start using arrow functions for methods. Take a look at the example below:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet: () => {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); // Prints undefined
In the comment, you can see that goat.diet() would log undefined. So what happened? Notice that in the .diet() is defined using an arrow function.

Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. In the code snippet above, the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope, which doesn’t have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.

To read more about either arrow functions or the global object check out the MDN documentation of the global object and arrow functions.

The key takeaway from the example above is to avoid using arrow functions when using this in a method!

Let's use the same example, but with a different
name:
*/

const advancedRobot = {
  energyLevel: 100,
  checkEnergy()  {
    console.log('Energy is currently at ' + advancedRobot.energyLevel + '%')
  }
}

advancedRobot.checkEnergy();

// PRIVACY

/* As I was reading the Codecademy documentation on 
Javascript objects, I found out an interesting thing about 
some things called getters and setters (We'll find out
what these are in the next lessons).

Accessing and updating properties is fundamental in working with objects. However, there are cases in which we don’t want other code simply accessing and updating an object’s properties. When discussing privacy in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.

Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here’s an example of using _ to prepend a property.

const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}
In the example above, the _amount is not intended to be directly manipulated.

Even so, it is still possible to reassign _amount:

bankAccount._amount = 1000000;

In later exercises, we’ll cover the use of methods called getters and setters. Both methods are used to respect the intention of properties prepended, or began, with _. Getters can return the value of internal properties and setters can safely reassign property values. For now, let’s see what happens if we can change properties that don’t have setters or getters.

Example below:
*/

const anotherRobot = {
  _energyLevel: 100,
  recharge(){
    this._energyLevel += 30;
    console.log(`Recharged! Energy is currently at ${this._energyLevel}%.`)
  }
};

anotherRobot._energyLevel = 'high';
console.log(anotherRobot.recharge());

// This returns: 

// Recharged! Energy is currently at high30%.
// undefined

// Notice that a funky string is printed to the console!
// This is known as a side-effect of type-coercion. 
// No need to worry about what this means for now, but 
// it’s important to understand that you can cause unwanted
// side-effects when mutating objects and their properties.
