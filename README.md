# Javascript-Documentation

For a long time, I've been wanting to begin with a personal documentation of my Javascript journey where I write down and note 
everything that I'm learning and at the same time people are learning with me...

Well, after some time and at a time in my life where Javascript is starting to look familiar to me, I decided to start this "project" and also start
learning again and brushing up my knowledge on Javascript.

Each commit would have a single chapter of me learning something new on this language, enjoy!
